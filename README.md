# Rubik's Cube Solver

An optimal solver for the Rubik's Cube implemented in C++. 

### Requirements:

 - A C++11 compiler
 - Boost >= 1.56

### Usage:

Compile the program and run it with

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./Rubiks_Cube_Solver

At the moment there is no interactive mode. You need to specify your scrambles in `test.cpp` and recompile.
