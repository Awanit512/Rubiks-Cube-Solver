# Rubik's Cube Solver

An optimal solver for the Rubik's cube implemented in C++. 

### Usage:

Specify your C++ compiler in the `Makefile`. The compiler needs to support C++11. 
Then run 

    make dep
    make
    ./test

At the moment there is no interactive mode. You need to specify your scrambles in `test.cpp` and recompile.
